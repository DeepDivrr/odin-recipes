        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This pie is filled with your dreams. You thought about this pie for hours and hours. You decided to try to make it, and inevitably hit a dead end. You leave the pie overnight to think, only to find a bug-infested mess the day after. You become frustrated. Angry at what you've created. Is this the pie you wanted? Is this all you can make with your skill level? Is this even worth it? What happened to all of those features you wanted to add? The decorations... the extra sweeteners... are you even going to get to them? Will you even finish this pie?</p>
        <p>There are many unfinished pies lying in the road towards mastery. This recipe will only be a guide. <em>Beware.</em></p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Half a cup of Optimism</li>
            <li>Planning papers</li>
            <li>An unknown amount of Time and Care </li>
            <li>5 versions of the App at different times. These will serve as your App-les</li>
            <li>Bits and pieces found from the road towards mastery, dropped off by other adventurers</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat Oven to 180 degrees C.</li>
            <li>Regurgitate half a cup of Optimism from your mind, and melt it in the oven. Tear up your planning papers and sprinkle them on top. Return the mixture to the oven while you prepare the App-les.</li>
            <li>Slice the app-les into 16 pieces, then sprinkle them on the mixture and place some Time and Care on top of it. Do this 5 times.</li>
            <li>Take the mixture out after some time and throw it away.</li>
            <li>Find a better app-le pie on the road towards mastery.</li>
            <li>Acquire permission to use the App-le pie.</li>
            <li>Use the App-le pie and credit the baker.</li>
        </ol>
